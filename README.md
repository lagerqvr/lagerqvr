<h2 align="left">Hi üëãüèº, I'm Rasmus</h1>

<p>I'm a Full-Stack Developer based in Finland, with a strong focus on web development and an expanding interest in DevOps and Cybersecurity. After graduating with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Information Technology, I've been applying my skills in a range of technologies including HTML & CSS, JavaScript (React.js & Next.js), Python, SQL, and Java. With three years of industry experience under my belt, I'm committed to building dynamic, robust, and user-friendly applications.

Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn if you're interested in discussing technology, sharing ideas, or exploring potential collaborations. I'm always open to learning from others and sharing my own experiences.
